title: Patience
---

Last month I made it a challenge to mediate every morning, read tons of meditation books, and then be able to blog about how my life has transformed since I had started.

I was able to complete only one meditation book, "Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English", but I wasn't successful in hitting 100% meditation.  Of course, this was an ambitious goal, but nothing is too ambitious when you prioritize your life around something.  Especially something as important as establishing spirituality in a world of chaos.  A world where I still don't know what I want to do with my life.  A world where there are too many books to read, too many computer languages to learn, and I end up in a state of paralysis and don't accomplish anything.  I'm in a race against time, and I can't ever catch up.  I want to learn too many things, I want to program in every language that's on Hacker News, I want to be a part of the hottest field.  I want to speak perfect Spanish and write perfect English.  I want to play soccer, volleyball, and cycle every day to work.  I want to teach children, I want to master the skills that I'm doing at work, and also master skills during my leisure time, completely unrelated to work so that I can keep my skills sharp.  

I want to devote small chunks of time, every day, to everything.  There isn't enough time in the day, so I neglect other facets of my life like family, friends, and video games.  Things that make me real happy, but that don't align with me becoming the best programmer in the world.  I want to do it all.  I want to be superman, but I can't.  I want to make everyone happy at my expense.  I want to be the best uncle, the best brother, and son. 

I leave no room for error.  My family doesn't contact me because they're worried they'll interfere.  Sometimes when I'm busy I won't take the call, and promise myself that I'll call THEM back, with the full intention that they will answer and that we'll speak on MY terms.  There is no exception to this.  If they fail to answer, they know that I'll get caught up with something again and they won't hear from me until the next day, at the earliest. 

The amount of time I spend with Sarah in bed has diminished.  The minute I wake up I HAVE to meditate.  It's what I'm supposed to do because my mind is most free from the distractions.  Then when I'm done with meditating, I need to focus on my writing to try and capture most of the thoughts that were flying through my brain while I was dreaming.  By the time I know it, Sarah has already gotten out of bed, prepared breakfast, and is in the bedroom blow-drying her air.  We used to wake up together (over-sleeping most of the time, but it was okay because cuddling time is good).  We used to wake up to alarm songs that would play George Strait, cook breakfast together, and even work out together when our wedding date was quickly approaching.  

The evenings are no different.  I'm trying to read up to forty pages a day, and I can't seem to find enough time for that either.  My cuddling time ends up sacrificing because I'm always left reading a book in bed, or I go to bed super early so that I can wake up super early to meditate before Sarah wakes up.

This isn't how it's supposed to be.  My trek toward ultimate productivity is pushing me into isolation.  I can't even remember the last time I took my dogs to the park.  Worse, we haven't even taken Comet to jump into any body of water.  He could be a world record-breaking weenie dog and I would never know it.   

I'm living my life as if I've lived through most of it already, when I'm only one third of the way through (and I barely remember the first half of it).  I'm comparing myself to the best of every field that I'm interested in.  The best athletes, the best coders, the best writers, the best mechanics, the best friends.  Now, I'm left with nothing.  Why can't I enjoy my life like everyone else?   Why can't I be content with where I am, with what I'm learning?

It's still very important to me to want to accomplish every one of the things that I'm working on.  The thing I can't grasp though is the notion of patience.  I could take every one of the things I just mentioned in and focus on one thing every month, rather than focusing on all of them every day.  Another problem could be that I'm not conditioned to writing so much, or reading so much, that it's not easy for me to "knock something out" in 30 minutes to an hour.  Instead, I'm reading complicated books, loaded with definitions and concepts that I'm not familiar with, so it's taking me four-times the time to accomplish what I'm seeking out.

Another thing, why do I feel like "Writing" daily translates to PUBLISHING a blog every day?  I don't know of  many bloggers who do this, so why am I trying?  Why can't I tackle a blog in a weekly span, or even a month.  I can make edits every day, revise my work, and get it ready for prime time.  Who the hell do I think I am?  Who am I trying to be?  

This world is going no where.  We're ultimately all insignificant when viewed from a cosmic perspective.  I need to coast through my awesome life, enjoy all the beautiful moments that present themselves to me, and make sure I know what my priorities are.  There are a lot of things in life that aren't worth your time.  Build up the perfect filter.

Be patient.
