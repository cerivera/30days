The style of meditation that I do is called Vipassana.  Unlike Zen, Vipassana welcomes distracting thoughts. The more you acknowledge and push away these thoughts, the more mindful, and at peace, you become.

To begin, try to pick a 20 minute time slot that you normally have to yourself so that you can build a habit around it.  I like to do it first thing after waking up, when my mind is fresh from distractions and thoughts, or as a winding-down phase right before going to bed.  Next, gather your materials.  If you don't have carpet, grab a yoga mat or lay a towel on the ground, and grab something to sit on; It's recommended to grab something that will elevate your butt by about two or three inches.  Beginners should start with something a little softer, like a throw pillow; I've noticed my legs don't fall asleep as badly when I use one. Lastly, you need to set any timer to 20 minutes.  

Now you have everything you need to get started.  Ranging from easiest to hardest, either sit with your legs crossed Indian style, in a half lotus (one heel on your thigh), or a full lotus (both heels on your thigh).   The full lotus maximizes the amount of time you can stay sitting in one position.  Your legs will inevitably go to sleep, but you shouldn't worry; the pain comes from a pinched nerve rather than blood circulation.  This entire process becomes easier over time.

Take a few deep breaths, rest your hands on your knees, sit up straight as if your spine traced the line of a stack of books, start your timer, and close your eyes.  You don't have to make any noise during meditation, and you don't have to breathe irregularly.  The trick is to feel the air flowing in and out at the tips of your nostrils.  It's very important that you focus on one physical part of your nose so that you always have a place to return to after being distracted.

During meditation, it’s important to acknowledge all thoughts that creep into your mind.  Briefly, try to understand why it's interrupting your meditation and then mentally push it away.  Think of it like getting absorbed by one of many thought bubbles that are floating above your head.  Whenever this happens, push yourself out of that bubble and return your mind to the present — your breath.

The more thoughts you push away, the stronger your awareness becomes.  Each step is progress towards complete awareness.  It's important that you always come back to that one specific point at the tip of your nose that you've been focusing on.  Don't try to fight any thoughts, just relax, listen to your breath, and see what happens next.  The more times you get distracted and become aware of the distractions, the faster you will build up your awareness. 

Good luck!
