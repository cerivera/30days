title: 30-Days Challenge
---

It's not an original idea, but this blog is dedicated to keeping track of my 30 day commitments.

To gain writing momentum, and to get me closer to writing my first Able blog, my
first challenge will be about writing myself a tutorial every day.  I always
have the hardest time blogging about something because I know it's been done
before; to circumvent this, I'm going to target my tutorials towards me.  I'm
the audience, and I'd love to read a tutorial in my own words.
