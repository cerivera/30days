<p>It felt great getting up this morning.  I’m surprised.  I think we went to bed closer to eleven at night, but I ended up waking up around five.  I tried going straight to the computer to begin this blog post but the light felt like daggers penetrating my eyes.  In The Passionate Programmer I remember reading that it’s always best to do a giant brain dump in the mornings as soon as you wake up.  Your mind is busy sifting through old information throughout the night so the idea is to try and capture some of that while it’s still fresh.  It seems like some of that information would be lost on me by the time I get to a computer so I need to start leaving a notepad and pencil by my bed so I can get started with it right away.</p>

<p>As I begin writing this month, what kind of things interest me?  What could I share with the world that is unique to me?  What do people, when they see me, seem most interested about what I have to say?</p>

<p>Well, grilling/barbecuing is a fun one but I don’t have as much experience grilling vegetables or tofu as I do with meat.  This is a great opportunity to learn something new, though.</p>

<p>A blog on how to save money would be fun.  I can showcase small tools that I build that keep me from overspending.</p>

<p>Living an ethical, simple, happy life seems like a GREAT idea just because it will always keep me in that mindset. It would be a constant reminder to myself to live a simple life and after a while it will become a habit.  This can even incorporate some of the tools that I was planning on building for my finance blog since living simply leads to saving money.  I can talk about how to make very simple recipes that are far superior to the store bought stuff.  Or even showing off the versatility of a tool in the kitchen by making it the ‘Tool of the Week’.</p>
